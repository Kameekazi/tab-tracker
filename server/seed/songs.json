		"lyrics": "I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla\nBetter hit the deck like the card dealer\nMy whole squad's in here, walking around the party\nA cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby \"The\nBrain\" Heenan which is probably the\nSame reason I wrestle with mania\nShady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up\nConsider it to cross me a costly mistake\nIf they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia\nAdhd, Hydroxycut\nPass the Courvoisi' (ayy, ayy)\nIn AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate\nBetter vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (ayy)\nThis beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A\nLaughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames\nThey cannot tame or placate the\nMonster (ayy)\nYou get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)\nI'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)\nWhen the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers\nI look like a villain outta those blockbusters\nGodzilla, fire spitter, monster\nBlood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\nFire, Godzilla, fire, monster\nBlood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\nI'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em, \"Lick the balls\"\nHad 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off\nIt's impossible to list 'em all\nAnd in the midst of all this\nI'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball\nTryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?\nRisperdal, voices whisper\nMy fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn\nThis is just the song to go ballistic on\nYou just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher\nI'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological\nQuick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka\nWhen you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a\nMonster (ayy)\nYou get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)\nI'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (yeah)\nWhen the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers\nI look like a villain outta those blockbusters\nGodzilla, fire spitter, monster\nBlood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\nFire, Godzilla, fire, monster\nBlood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\nIf you never gave a damn, raise your hand\n'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans\nI'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is\nThe motherfuckin' finger (finger), prostate exam ('xam)\nHow can I have all these fans and perspire?\nLike a liar's pants, I'm on fire\nAnd I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire\nThese chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier\nI got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers\nAnd what goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw\n'Cause I caught the flap of my dollar stack right off the bat like a baseball\nLike Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy\n'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (cheesecake) yeah\nBitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher\nWon't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care\nBut I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her\nFace on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez\nChristian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well\nSo they wanna give me the chair\nLike a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Caray\n'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary\nGot 'em swearing up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious\nIt's time to put these bitches in the obituary column\nWe wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem\nGet the shaft like a steering column (Mark Jack)\nTrigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink\nEvil half of the Bad Meets Evil\nThat means take a back seat\nTake it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single\nLook at my rap sheet, what attracts these people\nIs my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle\nI stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto\nFill 'em with the venom and el-lemonade 'em\nOther words, I minute made 'em\nI don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage\nI'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him\nFinna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in the lake\nObliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em\nAnd I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid\nBut don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway\n'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill\nI'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer, be the vanilla gorilla\nYou're bringin' the killer within me out of me\nYou don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me\nOr being the recievin' enemy, what stupidity it'd be\nEvery bit of me is the epitome of a spitter\nWhen I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck\nOr you finna be dead the minute you run into me\nA hunnid percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me\nI'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable\nYou wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable\nI'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable\nI'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full\nI'm not afraid to pull the\nMan, stop\nLook what I'm plannin', haha",
